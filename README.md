# INFX 551 Foundations of Data Curation

New to Github? Cool - we'll go over this in Week 2. Be sure to sign-up for a Github account before that date.

New to Markdown?  This is a really simple syntax - its a lot like editing Wikipedia - here is a great [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).


Next steps: 

1. `Fork` this repository 
2. Add me `nniiicc`  and your teammates as a collaborator 
3. Change this read me file (see note below on markdown). Add the title of your project, and a brief description.
4. Go to `Settings` and make sure the `Issues` box is checked. (This allows your forked repository to have its own set of issues)

There are a number of folders, and I suggest keeping the file strucutre as I have arranged it. This inlcudes: 

1. Code: You can put any software that you have used for your final project. This is 100% optional - you may not use or write any code for this project. 
2. Data: Add curated datasets - more specific instructions forthcoming
3. Documentation: Any additional documentaiton (data dictionary, etc.) should go here. 
4. Final Report: TBD
5. Use-Cases: For your second assignment you will write up a use-case following the W3C format for Data on the Web Best Practices. The use-case will be related to the quarter project, so I'd like you to place all of these in the same folder. If you write this document as a `.doc` you can use an online [tool](https://word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com/) to convert to markdown `.md`. 


## Curation Protocol Pitch: Meteorological Data

#### Team Members: Casey Pham, Ian Durra, Jiha Kang

#### Topic: Curation of Meteorological Data

Meteorological data is essential in understanding our world, and more importantly the future of our world. We will focus on the United States' meteorological and climate data, as there have recently been vast changes in the storage of this data. Our focus will be a protocol to provide simplified data meant for the community, those who are not already embedded within meteorology and atmospheric science.

#### Potential User Community

The user community will include the general public and community scientists.

#### Potential Data

1. NOAA Climate Data
2. Climate Prediction Center
3. NCAR UCAR Climate Data Guide

We will focus 

#### Potential Curation Activities
This is a very broad area, and has several challenges:
1. Access to relevant information and data
2. Normalizing data across data sources and schemas
3. Simplification of complicated data sets (NetCDF) to more familiar, widespread formats such as .csv



#### Next Steps
1. Narrow down user community. Potentiallly: lay/common persons? Non-meteorology persons
2. Narrow down datasets and data types
3. Potential activity: Conversion from industry standard (ie NetCDF) to a more common format such as .csv
