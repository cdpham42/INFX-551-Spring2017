## Curation Protocol Pitch: Meteorological Data

#### Team Members: Casey Pham, Ian Durra, Jiha Kang

#### Topic: Curation of Meteorological Data

Meteorological data is essential in understanding our world, and more importantly the future of our world. We will focus on the United States' meteorological and climate data, as there have recently been vast changes in the storage of this data. Our focus will be a protocol to provide simplified data meant for the community, those who are not already embedded within meteorology and atmospheric science.

#### Potential User Community

The user community will include the general public and community scientists.

#### Potential Data

1. NOAA Climate Data
2. Climate Prediction Center
3. NCAR UCAR Climate Data Guide

We will focus 

#### Potential Curation Activities
This is a very broad area, and has several challenges:
1. Access to relevant information and data
2. Normalizing data across data sources and schemas
3. Simplification of complicated data sets (NetCDF) to more familiar, widespread formats such as .csv



#### Next Steps
1. Narrow down user community. Potentiallly: lay/common persons? Non-meteorology persons
2. Narrow down datasets and data types
3. Potential activity: Conversion from industry standard (ie NetCDF) to a more common format such as .csv
